Radio-frequency  identification  (RFID)  is an automatic  identification method,  relying on 
storing and remotely retrieving data using devices called RFID tags or transponders. The 
technology requires some extent of cooperation of an RFID reader and an RFID tag. 
An RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or 
person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. Some tags can be 
read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader.
