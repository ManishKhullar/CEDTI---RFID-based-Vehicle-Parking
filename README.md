# CEDTI---RFID-based-Vehicle-Parking

_WHAT IS RFID?_ 
 
A basic RFID system consists of three components: 
 
a) An antenna or coil 
b) A transceiver (with decoder) 
c) A transponder (RF tag)  
 
Electronically programmed with unique  information. There  are many different  types of 
RFID  systems  out  in  the  market.  They  are  categorized  according  to  there  frequency 
ranges. Some of the most commonly used RFID kits are as follows: 
 
1) Low-frequency (30 KHz to 500 KHz) 
2) Mid-Frequency (900KHz to 1500MHz) 
3) High Frequency (2.4GHz to 2.5GHz) 
 
These  frequency  ranges mostly  tell  the RF  ranges  of  the  tags  from  low  frequency  tag 
ranging  from  3m  to  5m, mid-frequency  ranging  from  5m  to  17m  and  high  frequency 
ranging from 5ft  to 90ft.


**DATA CAPACITY 
** 
The amount of data storage on a tag can vary, ranging from 16 bits on the low end to as 
much as several thousand bits on the high end. Of course, the greater the storage capacity, 
the higher the price per tag. 

TYPICAL APPLICATIONS fOR RFID  
•  Automatic Vehicle identification 
•  Inventory Management  
•  Work-in-Process  
•  Container/ Yard Management  
•  Document/ Jewellery tracking  
•  Patient Monitoring  

# ABSTRACT

```RFID based Vehicle parking system.
Since the beginnig of the twentyfirst century, it has become mandatory to use cars and two wheelers as the means of transport. As the no. of vehicles increases there comes another challenge to manage the parking space for these vehicles. The manual methods are much time consuming. Thus there arises the need to create an automated parking system. 
RFID technology is a unique and affordable technology to provide authenticity to any particular product, animal, or person and also to provide security of the same. These utilise the Radio Waves to allow the vehicle to enter or leave the premisis thereby eliminating to wait in line for issuing of tickets providing unique identification. ```
